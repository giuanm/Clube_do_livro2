Book Club was developed in NodeJS using Express, Handlebars and MySQL. In this project it is possible to register users with some types of validations, such as password validations. After user registration, it will be possible to log in to the platform and comment on a book, adding the title of the book, the author and a brief comment about that book. CRUD was created for these comments. In the comments viewing tab, it is possible to sort by creation date and search by title of commented books.

## Getting started and How to use:

After cloning the repository, you must connect a web server to MySQL (I use XAMPP) and start with the 'npm start' command. You will then be able to access via localhost on port 5000. When opening the page you will be able to register a user and log in to start commenting. For comments it is possible to do CRUD.
